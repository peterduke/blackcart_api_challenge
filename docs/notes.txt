returning HTML 404s instead of JSON

returning weights in kg for shopify, not clear what it will be for woocommerce

woocommerce 
    doesn't have prices in different currencies
    'stock_quantity' can be NULL while 'stock_status' is 'instock'
        so might not be suitable to answer question 
        "are we out of stock"

shopify
    prices, weights, quantities are specific to variants so just taking the last available or the sum
    didn't have an example of item with different sizes
